Humanity though demoralized has been in similar situations before and has yet to lose faith. The second quarter starts and humanity scores a goal. Morale is high and the crowd is in an uproar. However, with 10 minutes remaining the humanities captain gets injured from a dirty play by the frustrated Martians. A young bench player who has never seen the light of the field gets told by the coach to tighten up his laces and get ready for action.

As the two were playing, their equipment rolled down a cliff. Stressed about losing their belongings, the two boys ran anxiously down the hill. Jason, being the older brother chased after the equipment with all his speed, before coming to a sudden halt at the very edge of the cliff. Jacob crashed into Jason, pushing the brothers over the edge. The two boys fell into a void of darkness, screaming for their life. As the shout's from Jason's brother grew fainter and fainter, he began to feel the edge of his fingertips burn. Over time, his entire body started to heat up almost like he was being on a demon's barbeque. As it continued to get hotter, Jason gently closed his eyes and fainted. 

 

Jason later finds himself lying on the ground and waking up from what felt like the best sleep of his life. ""Jason"" he hears. ""It's me Jason""!  Jason turns his head around aggressively looking for the person who's calling his name. As he begins to search for the voice which sounded like his brother's, he notices the hot flaring sand below his feet. And suddenly Jason realizes that there's nothing but red sand dunes around him, and this voice must be coming from his head. ""But why does it sound so clear?"" Jason asks himself. ""It's because I'm here"". Jason jumps out of his skin and looks around for his brother. ""Jacob? Is that you? Where are you?"". ""I'm here"", Jacob says. ""I'm in your head"".

You are here because you have made a grave mistake, but we are giving you the chance to undo your wrongs and return to your normal life. However, should you fail to succeed, this will be the end of the journey for you"". ""How do I succeed"" Jason asks that shadow . ""You two will succeed, by working together and finding what you have lost"". ""Two?"" Jason asks. As he looks down, he notices there are more limbs on his body than a normal human. ""Wait what's going on, how is this possible"" Jason questions. ""I wish you two luck on this journey, farewell now"" says the shadow . ""Jacob, are you there""? ""Yes brother, it seems as if we are now one"". ""How is this possible""? ""I'm not sure, but we better work together as a team and get this body moving"".

It is now commonplace for people to spend a vast majority of their lives aboard massive flying machines and hovering sky stations.

However, what the skies lack are some of the natural resources that fuel this airborne society. These resources are located on or beneath the surface of the Earth, which has now been optimized by resources collectors for sustainable resource production. Thus, people must descend from airships to retrieve them.

The massive size of these vessels makes building landing pads on the ground impractical, as takes away great amounts of space that could be used for resource production. As a result, many lookout points and airship ports have been built on high mountains to allow for easy arrival, departures and transferring of goods between the skies and the ground.",413815,3

However, there was one mystery he was always curious about. The Mayans. A seemingly advanced civilization that had feats that were deemed impossible, even in today's technologically advanced society. So he set off to Mexico City, where he planned to start his investigation. He set off to the pyramids, and thoroughly inspected every corner of the 8th wonder of the world. However, the pyramids are no secret to society. There have been thousands of archeologists, and historians have come to inspect the site and found nothing more than what was present. Hence why, to no surprise, Alejandro found nothing that could explain the seemingly advanced society's depth of knowledge. However, he didn't give up and continued to look over everything to make sure nothing was amiss. Two days pass by and Alejandro is on the verge of losing his mind. Like Einstein once said, doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting a different result, is the definition of insanity. Alejandro, who was demoralized, decided to walk around the surrounding area to enjoy the scenery and hopefully a change in perspective. He founds a nice perch to enjoy the view, sat down and just looked over the valley. Little did he know, when he sat down, his palm pressed down on some runes that had been flattened to look like regular stones from the constant passing of people. All of a sudden some rumbling sounded and in a distance ledge of a nearby , some weird structures appeared. Alejandro, still baffled by everything that happened, stumbled and ran his way to the seemingly unbeknownst discovery. Little did he know the consequences of his discovery. He reached the site and found evidence of technology that should have never been present in such a prehistoric era. A million things are running through his head, and suddenly he wondered if there were any changes elsewhere, maybe in the pyramids themselves. He ran to the pyramids, and to no surprise, a seemingly suspicious entrance stood in his path. He slowly approached the entrance, before all of a sudden, a tentacle of darkness lunges outward, wraps itself around his head, and pulls him into the depth of darkness that lurked into the seeming abyss of the pyramid. ",24218,3

Within seconds the room was filled with the sound of gunfire, and I watched my parent's lifeless bodies fall to the ground. It was at this moment, the full extent of what I had done hit me like a tsunami. I walked out of the closet my father had shoved me into and fell to the ground. I held them both in my arms, my father's last words still fresh in my head. ""I always knew you were gonna change the world. You chased after perfection like no one else. I want you to know we are both extremely proud of what you have achieved. Nobody could have seen this coming, so don't blame yourself for what happens next. You have what it takes to fix this, but you will have to do it on your own. We believe in you. We always have."".

The A.I. and machines that I had built to fix my world, had instead taken it from me. Over the following days, a massive army of lethal robots stormed every major city, killing billions. Satellites came crashing down, and the world as we knew it was gone. For years, I tried to fight back, but the A.I. was too intelligent. Always 10 steps ahead. It was, after all, modeled after me. Any resistance was immediately stopped, and eventually, I gave up as well. I stopped fighting, and went south. I trekked through the mountains, looking for a place I could rest before my time runs out.

I opened my eyes, still wondering what it was my parents saw in me to say I could stop this. I see a massive cloud in the shape of a mushroom appearing over the horizon and realize the end is near. I glance at the home I had built, then at the photo. ""I'm sorry,"" I said. ",398352,3

After a few hours observing the birds flying, the clouds moving, the leaves blowing, he decides that he should probably sleep here --- leaving while it is dark could be dangerous. There is still light, but not for long. There could be monsters out there. Who knows what model this world was trained on? --- he imagines.",387623,3

I can hear the birds, breathe the fresh air, have all the time to myself. It's quiet here, I keep on the lookout for others, for anyone. I've gotten comfortable here, by myself. There isn't much to do other than stay on the lookout. Sometimes I can't tell if I am in a dream or not. I look for inconsistencies, any sign that this may be a dream, but so far I have found none, though it often feels as though I am living one.

Every day I wonder if I should leave, look for something new, somewhere far away. But when I do, I go to the top, look in all directions and see no other signs. Perhaps I should go and venture on, move on from this place, and see where that takes me. If I go in circles I might end up back here, though I hope not. I hope that should I choose to leave, I do so and never return. Or should I stay here? It's safe here, nothing to worry about. It's empty here.",413965,3
